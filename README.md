Assignment 2 - networking game 

Team Members: Mateo Castillo, Harini Solaidurairaj, Muhammad Zeeshan

Formal Elements:

Players: Multiple players vs Game 

Objectives: Defeat Spider enemies while protecting hardware components 

Procedures: The players will look around for enemies and use cannons to shoot enemies or bump into them to kill them

Rules: Some players get a cannon, some players will have to use their character to bump into bugs. Bugs will go towards the hardware to damage it. 

Resources: Cannon, bullets 

Conflict: Enemy bugs are trying to steal/destroy hardware 

Boundaries: The players have a play space that they can not leave and the players are protecting hardware within walls
Outcome: The players need to kill the bugs so they get a good score before the timer ends 

Multiplayer Aspect: One player stays near the hardware on the inside of the walls to defeat enemies there. The other player will be defending from enemies outside the walls. The players must work together as there will be too many bugs for one player to handle successfully and the players will have to communciate to cover more ground and eliminate as many possible bugs.
Unusual Procedure: Only some players get a cannon, other players will have to use their character to bump into bugs 

Relevance to Game Theme: Our game follows the game theme because the enemy bugs are trying to steal and destroy the computer hardware hidden in the map. The Players are trying to eliminate the bugs to minimize theft/damage to the hardware. 

Serious Game Objective: A crucial part of the CPU is the Control Unit, ALU and Memory. Our goal is for the players to simulate being the CPU and making them protect the important parts of the CPU: The Control Unit, ALU and Memory. By the end of the game the players should have thought of what they were protecting if the place the hardware was being kept is the CPU. 

Our Serious Game Question: If the protected area is the CPU, what are you protecting inside the CPU?
Answer: The Control Unit, ALU and Memory
